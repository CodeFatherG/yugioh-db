You can target any number of your \"Visas\" monsters that are banished, in your GY, and/or on your field; shuffle those \"Visas\" monsters into the Deck, and if you do, Special Summon this card from your hand, and if you do that, it gains 400 ATK for each monster you shuffled with a different original name. You can only use this effect of \"Visas Samsara\" once per turn. If this card you control would be used as Synchro Material, you can treat it as a non-Tuner.",
