While this card is in Defense Position, your \"Odd-Eyes\" monsters cannot be destroyed by battle, also you take no battle damage from that battle. You can target 1 Level 1 monster in your GY; Special Summon it, but negate its effects (if any), and if you do, immediately after this effect resolves, Synchro Summon 1 Synchro Monster using only that monster and this card. You can only use this effect of \"Performapal Miss Director\" once per turn.",
